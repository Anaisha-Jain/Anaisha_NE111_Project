<h1>Final Project for NE 111</h1>
<ul>
    <li> This is my final project for my Coding course, NE 111! </li>
    <li> In this project, I have made a data analyser using Matplotlib, Pandas, and Streamlit!  </li>
    <li>The criteria of the project was to input data, and successfully graph it in various way. I did this through implementing matplotlib to suvvessfully use graphs for the given data, and allow the user to choose various types of ways to plot their data, and even upload it!
